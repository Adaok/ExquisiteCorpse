# Exquisite corpse

A Git exercise to explain some Git concepts 

Here all rules :
- Every cadavre exquis should be a nanofiction (280 char max).
- The owner of the repository begins each nanofiction with a sentence of about 33 characters.
- Each contributor makes a modification of about 33 characters. If necessary, he can modify some elements already written to correct the sentence from a grammatical or comprehension point of view.
- The contributor does not alter too much the nanofiction already written or risk not seeing it merged.

To contribute to :
- Start by fork this repo.
- Choose one nanofiction only.
- Contributors will have to create a branch with the name of the nanofiction and the name of the contributor like this "storyXX/githubName", like feature in gitflow.
- Add their contribution only to the nanofiction designated by the branch.
- Your commit message should be as professional as possible.
- Make a pull request to propose their literary contribution to the project.
- The owner of the repository takes care of accepting the pull request.
